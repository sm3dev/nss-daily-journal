      "message": "We got into APIs more today. Also, we learned about two more fancy ways to declare functions. I like the that there's a easy way to declare a single line function that does or doesn't pass an argument. \n I think that slash-n I just typed might drop to the next line. Probably won't though. We'll see what happens. The only reason I'm not feeling Awesome today and am only feeling Good is because I want to know how to automated the dateCreated values (or all date values really). We didn't cover that, so I might do some investigating on my own. Maybe -- but not before I catch up my Daily Journal the chapters",

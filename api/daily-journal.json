I like the that there's a easy way to declare a single line function that does or doesn't pass an argument. \n I think that slash-n I just typed might drop to the next line. Probably won't though. We'll see what happens. The only reason I'm not feeling Awesome today and am only feeling Good is because I want to know how to automated the dateCreated values (or all date values really). We didn't cover that, so I might do some investigating on my own. Maybe -- but not before I catch up my Daily Journal the chapters.",

I've been looking forward to display only one item at a time because I have a personal project I want to build. For the last 2-3 years, I've been listing facts about myself in an Google Doc with the intent to use them on my website About page. \nThe idea is that a site visitor can click a button that displays a random fact about me from the list.

Since yesterday, I've been going back through the chapters on Event Listeners.\n My mood isn't good. I really wanted more time on the individual stuff before we got into another group project. I still don't have full functionality of Giffygram. It is what it is, but I'm confused about when to get help on Giffygram and Daily Journal. I'll ask and find out.",
